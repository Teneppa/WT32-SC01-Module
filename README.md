The WT32-SC01 module is an ESP32 dev board which has a capacitive touch screen mounted on the same PCB.
I have been looking for a capacitive touch screen dev board for a while and now I finally found one, so I might as well document everything here
in case someone else finds the same module.

The documentation on this module is quite bad, but luckily there is already a couple of projects, so we don't have to reverse engineer the entire thing.
